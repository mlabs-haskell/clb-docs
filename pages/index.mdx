# CLB - Cardano Emulator that works

Welcome to CLB (pronounced /kl åb/)!

[CLB](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb)
(stands for _Cardano Ledger Backend_) is a two-in-one Cardano emulator
which can be used in two modes of operation depending on your needs:
* as a Haskell library
* as a cardano-node emualator

These two modes have different applications and behavior, see [variants of use](/use).
Check out the [getting started](/getting-started) page to start with CLB.

The core CLB library has been developed with the following ideas in mind:
* Being fully compatible with the `cardano-ledger` codebase.
* Minimal dependency set. CLB depends only on `plutus` and `cardano-ledger`.
No `plutus-apps` or `cardano-node` or Ouroboros.
* Works for Plutus V1, Plutus V2, and Plutus V3.
* Support for Babbage and Conway eras (one at a time though).
* Realistic usage estimation of resources even when they exceed limits.
* Using pure state and being blazingly fast to facilitate property-based testing.

# Maintenance

CLB is maintained by [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city) as a part of its core-tools endeavor.
Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/issues/new)
or ask a [question](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/discussions/new/choose) on GitHub.
CLB is an open-source project, so PRs are highly welcomed as well.

# Adoption

Here is the list of projects that use CLB or its parts:

* [Atlas](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas),
the modern PAB by [GeniusYield](https://www.geniusyield.co/) and others
uses CLB in lieu of decommissioned [PSM](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) library.
* [CTL](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib),
a Purescript-based set of tools for building dApps for browsers
developed by [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city) provides a way to use CLB
instead of `cardano-node` to speed up private network tests.
* [CEM Script](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/cem-script),
 a high-level Cardano SDK for building dApps from state-machine-like definition by
 [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city) uses bare CLB API to verify their models.

If you use CLB and your project is not on the list,

# History

In case you are interested in the CLB's story we recommend reading this
[report](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/blob/master/docs/reports/ms1/MS1-REPORT.md)
that goes to great lengths to present the whole story, particularly:
* How the predecessor of CLB, PSM library [was born](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/blob/master/docs/reports/ms1/MS1-REPORT.md#psm-brief-history-recap).
* What PSM looked like when [CLB was incepted](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/blob/master/docs/reports/ms1/MS1-REPORT.md#the-current-state).
* CLB as the [next-gen of PSM](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/blob/master/docs/reports/ms1/MS1-REPORT.md#the-current-state).
