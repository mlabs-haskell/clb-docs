# CLB - Cardano Emulator that works

Welcome to the CLB! (Pronounced /kl åb/).

CLB (stands for _cardano-ledger backend_) is two-in-one Cardano emulator
which can be used in two modes of operation depending on your needs:
* as a Haskell library
* as a cardano-node emualator

These two modes have different behaviour described in [variants of use](/modes).
