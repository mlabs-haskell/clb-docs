# Variants of use

There are two basic ways to use CLB within a project.

The preferred way is to plug it as a Haskell library into your project.
Depending on your needs you can use low-level [CLB's bare API](/lib)
or use high-level API by pairing it with [Atlas capabilities](/atlas)
to build transactions and tests.

An alternative option is running CLB as a standalone node emulator.
This is the only option for non-haskell projects or in cases when
the functionality of the library is too lean for one's purposes.

## Library mode

In the library mode CLB emulator just maintains the pure ledger in-memory state.
Neither is there notion of time, nor blocks.
The genesis is also absent and a user is expected
to provide initial fund distribution.

When a transaction comes in, it is validated against the state.
If it is valid then the state is immediately gets cranked,
moving into the next imaginary slot,
and the transaction is discarded.
The only information that is preserved is transaction's datums.
If the transaction happens to be invalid
a negative validation result with the reason is returned to the submitter.

## Node emulator mode

In the [node emulator mode](/node)
(also can be reffered to as the socket mode or the node mode)
things get more entangled.
In contrast to the library mode when the emulator is just a pure state in the memory
in the node mode the emulator represents a standalone process
that mimics a full-fledged Cardano node behaviour to some extent.
The process maintains an IPC socket the way the node does,
so one can use Ouroboros mini-protocols direcrtly
or pull in Ogmios to get more usable API.

The following additional things come into play when CLB is run in the node mode:
* A separate thread to count slots which emulates time.
* A mempool that maintains its own so-called "cached" state.
* A trivial block producing procedure that forges blocks
from the content of the mempool.
