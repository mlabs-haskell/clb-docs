# Getting started with CLB

The way you use CLB mostly depends on the mode you want to use.
Please refer to the [variants of use](/use) page
to figure out which one better suits your needs.

# Using standalone CLB library

Use one of the following methods and refer to the library [API](/use/lib).

## Using CLB from GitHub

Use `source-repository-package` with the latest revision in the `tag` field
to add CLB library from `clb` subfolder to your project in
`cabal.project`:

```
source-repository-package
  type: git
  location: https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb
  tag: 080e2b4852f162d33e8a3d5e2faaa9b5400d878c
  subdir:
    clb
```

## Using CLB from CHaP

Currently, CLB is not on the CHaP,
but we have [plans](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/issues/65) to do that.

# Using CLB library with Atlas

Unfortunately, Atlas setup currently is more involved.
You can find an example in this [repository](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/atlas-bet-ref).

For further information please refer to this [page](/use/atlas).

# Using CLB executable

In case you want to use CLB in the node emulation mode
you need only the executable.

Please refer to [this page](/use/node) for further information.

## Using CLB executable with Nix

For a Nix setup, you can use the `flake.nix` directly:

```nix
...
inputs = {
  ...
  # CLB emulator
  clb.url = "github:mlabs-haskell/clb";
  ...

  clb = clb.packages.${system}."socket-emulator:exe:cardano-node-socket-emulator";
  ...
```

## Building executable locally

Alternatively, you can build the executable locally, please refer to
[build](/build) page to get to the devshell. You can find the executable after
building CLB:

```bash
$ cabal list-bin cardano-node-socket-emulator
.../clb/dist-newstyle/.../cardano-node-socket-emulator
```
