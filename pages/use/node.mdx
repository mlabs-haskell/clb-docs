# Node emulator mode

For description of how this mode operates see a short
[introduction](/use#node-emulator-mode)
on the [Variants of use](/use) page.

## Getting CLB executable

The executable `cardano-node-socket-emulator` to run CLB
is a separate cabal project located in the project repository under
[emulator](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/clb/tree/master/emulator) folder.

Currently, no binary distribution is available so you have to include it into
your project using [Nix](/build#using-clb-with-nix)
or [build](/build#standalone-building) it separately.

## Spinning up  CLB instance

Almost like with a real `cardano-node` you have to provide a lot of things to the
binary to spin up an instance of emualator which is effectively a degenerated network
that consists of one only node which is in change of producing blokcs.

 Whereas you can prepare all things manually, the recommended way is to use
 [cardano-testnet](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-testnet) from
 [cardano-node](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node) repository.

 This tool is capable of generating network genesis and configuration
 based on your preferences and running any executable that can understand it
 by utilising `CARDANO_NODE` environment variable.

 That way having `cardano-testnet` executable at hand you can do this
 (pay attention that currently only text logging is supported):

 ```bash
 $ export CARDANO_NODE=/path/to/cardano-node-socket-emulator
 $ cardano-testnet \
     cardano
     --conway-era
     --testnet-magic 764824073
     --nodeLoggingFormat text
 ```

 Under the hood `cardano-testnet` generates a temporary folder which contains:
   * configuration, topology and genesis files
   * signing keys of genesis wallets
   * IPC socket for the nodes
   * logs

 Then it runs the binary set in `CARDANO_NODE` with the following set of parameters
 (listed here for informational purposes):

 ```bash
 $ cardano-node-socket-emulator run \
     --config /tmp/configuration.yaml
     --topology /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/topology.json
     --database-path /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/db
     --shelley-kes-key /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/kes.skey
     --shelley-vrf-key /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/vrf.skey
     --byron-delegation-certificate /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/byron-delegation.cert
     --byron-signing-key /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/byron-delegate.key
     --shelley-operational-certificate /tmp/pools-keys/pool2/opcert.cert
     --socket-path /tmp/socket/pool2/sock
     --host-addr 127.0. 0.1
     --port 43159
 ```

## Example: CLB as backend for privnet tests in CTL

As a reference example you can use the way CLB is integrated with
[cardano-transaction-lib](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib)
as it's done in this [PR](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/pull/1655).
