# Using CLB with Atlas

This page gives an overview of how CLB can be used together with
[Atlas](https://github.com/geniusyield/atlas).

CLB [low-level](/use/lib) API works with serialized transactions.
If your project can produce them somehow you can use it directly.
But if not &ndash; you need some off-chain machinery to build them.
This is a non-trivial tasks which is rather expensive to be done twice.
This is why we decided to get rid of the old custom PSM machinery for
transaction constructing and utlize Atlas PAB.

As a part of the CLB development effort
[**unified testing**](https://atlas-app.io/getting-started/testing#overview-of-unified-testing-in-atlas)
feature has been implemented in Atlas PAB.
It allows writing off-chain code for transaction building once
and reuse it in:
* CBL-emulator tests
* a real private network tests
* the application itself

A sample project that uses CLB with Atlas can be found
in [mlabs-haskell/atlas-bet-ref](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/atlas-bet-ref)
repository.
